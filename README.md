2: Web Application

All assignments must have a detailed view.  
All users can see a list of every assignment created.  
Manager users can create, delete, and edit assignments.  
Worker users can only view assignments and change the status of it.  
  
Possible Features:

Agile Planning:

Sprint 1: Build a layout of the project and Implement the core features. 

Create assignments and allow users to view them. Managers will be able to edit and change assignments, while workers will be able to change the statuses of the assignments but not the assignments themselves.

User Story 1:  As a worker, I want to view, and be able to update the status of an assignment, so that completed tasks can be marked when completed.

User Story 2: As a manager, I want to be able to create assignments, assign due dates to those assignemtns, list the workers involved, and edit the assignments I created, so the workers know who is responsible for the assignment as well as when it is due.
